After months of hardworking to develop a platform, to monitor the production of the SDG indicators, we decided to move on to the next fase. 

In this stage the intention was to present/publish the SDG indicators and their progress as for the general goals stipulated by the UN and the SDG community. 

This project was ejecuted in collaboration with the SDG-IWG commission and their feedback. After some recommendations and ideas, we started to upload to share the result of Promosi.
